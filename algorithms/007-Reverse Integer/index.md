Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:
```
Input: 123
Output: 321
```
Example 2:
```
Input: -123
Output: -321
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 120
Output: 21
```
Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
